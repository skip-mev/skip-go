title: 'Migration Guide'
---

<Warning>
  Both the Skip Router SDK `@skip-router/core` and Skip Go Core `@skip-go/core`
  are deprecated. Please migrate to Skip Go Client `@skip-go/client`, our
  actively maintained [TypeScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skip-go/client).
</Warning>

### Upcoming Breaking Changes

This section details the migration from previous versions to the latest `@skip-go/client`.

#### No More SkipClient Class

The `SkipClient` class has been removed. Instead, import and use individual functions directly:

```TypeScript TypeScript
import {
  assets,
  assetsBetweenChains,
  assetsFromSource,
  recommendAssets,
  bridges,
  balances,
  chains,
  venues,
  ibcOriginAssets,
  route,
  messages,
  messagesDirect,
  submitTransaction,
  trackTransaction,
  transactionStatus,
  executeRoute,
  setClientOptions,
  setApiOptions,
} from '@skip-go/client';
```

#### Initialization Changes

**If not using `executeRoute`:**

- Call `setApiOptions({ apiUrl, apiKey })` once at initialization.
- Alternatively, pass `apiUrl` and `apiKey` as arguments to each individual API function call.

**If using `executeRoute`:**

- Call `setClientOptions()` with the same options object previously passed to the `SkipClient` constructor.
- **Exception:** `getCosmosSigner`, `getEVMSigner`, and `getSVMSigner` have been removed from `setClientOptions`. These signer functions are now passed directly to `executeRoute` when needed.
- **Renamed:** `getEVMSigner` is now `getEvmSigner`, and `getSVMSigner` is now `getSvmSigner`.

**Example Migration:**

```Diff Diff
- const client = new SkipClient(options);
+ setClientOptions(options); // Only if using executeRoute

- client.chains();
+ chains(); // Assuming apiUrl/apiKey were set via setApiOptions or passed in
```

#### Build Format Change

The library build format has changed from CommonJS (CJS) to `ES Modules (ESM)`.

This change enables better tree-shaking, leading to significantly smaller bundle sizes for applications that don't use all the library's features.

<Info>
  If you're **not** using `executeRoute`, your final bundle size should decrease dramatically (e.g., from ~5MB to potentially ~7KB for a single API function usage), assuming tree-shaking is enabled in your bundler.
</Info>

#### Axios Removed

`axios` is no longer a dependency. All API calls now utilize the standard `window.fetch` API internally.

#### CamelCase Update

All property names in API responses and configuration objects now strictly adhere to `camelCase`.

**Examples:**

| Before          | After           |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `chainID`       | `chainId`       |
| `apiURL`        | `apiUrl`        |
| `logoURI`       | `logoUri`       |
| `asset.isCW20`  | `asset.isCw20`  |

### 4.0.0 Breaking changes

- Removed `clientID` param in `SkipClient`
- Added `apiKey` param in `SkipClient`
- Added `requiredChainAddresses` in `SkipClient.route` response
- Added `smartSwapOptions` in `SkipClient.route`request

```JavaScript JavaScript
smartSwapOptions:{
	splitRoutes: boolean
}
```

### 3.0.0 Breaking Changes

- Changed Param Type: `userAddresses` from a map of chainIDs to addresses to an array of `UserAddress` types:
-

```TypeScript TypeScript
export interface UserAddress {
  chainID: string;
  address: string;
}
```

### 2.0.0 Breaking changes

- Removed Method: `SkipClient.executeMultiChainMessage`
- Renamed Method: `SkipClient.getGasAmountForMessage` \-> `SkipClient.getCosmosGasAmountForMessage`
- Renamed Method: `SkipClient.getFeeForMessage` \-> `SkipClient.getCosmosFeeForMe`
- Renamed Type: `MultiChainMsg` \-> `CosmosMsg`
- Renamed Method & Params changed: `SkipClient.executeMultiChainMsgs`\-> `SkipClient.executeTxs`

```Diff Diff
const client = new SkipClient({
  apiURL: SKIP_API_URL,
// ... rest of your configs
});
- client.executeMultiChainMsgs({
+ client.executeTxs({
	...options
-	msgs: types.Msg[]
+	txs: types.Tx[]
})
```

- Param Changed in `SkipClient.executeCosmosMessage`: `message:MultiChainMsg` \-> `messages: CosmosMsg[]`

```Diff Diff
const client = new SkipClient({
  apiURL: SKIP_API_URL,
// ... rest of your configs
});
client.executeCosmosMessage({
	...options
-	message: MultiChainMsg
+	messages: CosmosMsg[]
})
```
