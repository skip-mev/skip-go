## Adding custom messages before or after route execution

The `executeRoute` method now accepts `beforeMsg` and `afterMsg`  parameter to allow for the execution of custom Cosmos messages before and/or after the route is executed. This is useful for executing custom messages that are not part of the route definition.


```typescript
const msg = JSON.stringify({
  fromAddress: 'cosmos1...',  // Replace with sender address
  toAddress: 'cosmos1...',    // Replace with recipient address
  amount: [{
    denom: 'uatom',           // Replace with the actual denom, e.g., 'uatom' for ATOM
    amount: '1000000'         // Replace with the actual amount (in smallest unit, e.g., micro-ATOM)
  }]
});

await executeRoute({
  route,
  userAddresses,
  beforeMsg: { msg, msgTypeUrl: '/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend' }
});
```
## Use the Go Fast Transfer system

The `route` function accepts a `goFast` parameter to enable the Go Fast Transfers. Then pass this route to the `executeRoute` method to execute.
```typescript
import { executeRoute, route } from '@skip-go/client';

const route = await route({
  goFast: true
  ...otherParams,
}); 

await executeRoute({
  route,
  ...otherParams,
});
```
