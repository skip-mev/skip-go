<Info>
Anxious to get started? See a live example of this [code](https://github.com/skip-mev/skip-go-example) in our [example app](https://skip-next-simple-example.vercel.app/). 
</Info>
<Steps> 
<Step title="Install Library">

Install the library using npm or yarn:

<CodeGroup>
```Shell npm
npm install @skip-go/client
```
```Shell yarn
yarn add @skip-go/client
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step> <Step title="Initialize Client">

To start integrating with the Skip Go API, initialize a `SkipClient` instance. This `skipClient` provides helper methods for common actions such as querying assets and chains, constructing routes, and executing transactions.

```ts
import { SkipClient } from "@skip-go/client";

const skipClient = new SkipClient({
  // Signers will be set up in the following section
});
```

The SkipClient constructor accepts an optional configuration object of type `SkipClientOptions`. Here's a brief overview:

- `apiURL?: string`: Override the default API URL
- `endpointOptions?: EndpointOptions`: Provide RPC and REST endpoints for specific chains
- `aminoTypes?: AminoConverters`: Additional amino types to be for message encoding
- `registryTypes?: Iterable<[string, GeneratedType]>`: Additional registry types 

</Step> <Step title="Setup Signers">

To execute transactions, you need to set up signers for the ecosystems you plan to interact with. Below are examples for Cosmos SDK, EVM, and Solana (SVM). Note that for EVM and SVM, you'll need to install additional libraries.

### Signer Setup
<CodeGroup>

```ts Cosmos Signer
// For Cosmos transactions, we'll use Keplr wallet from the window object
const getCosmosSigner = async (chainID: string) => {
  const offlineSigner = await window.keplr?.getOfflineSigner(chainID);
  if (!offlineSigner) throw new Error("Keplr not installed or chain not added");
  return offlineSigner;
};

```

```ts EVM Signer
// For EVM transactions, we'll use MetaMask and viem
// npm install viem
import { createWalletClient, custom, Account } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains';

const getEVMSigner = async () => {
  const ethereum = window.ethereum;
  if (!ethereum) throw new Error("MetaMask not installed");
  const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' }) as Account[];
  const account = accounts?.[0] 
  if (!account) throw new Error('No accounts found');
  const client = createWalletClient({
    account,
    chain: mainnet,
    transport: custom(window.ethereum),
  });
  return client;
}
```

```ts SVM Signer
// For Solana transactions, we'll use the Phantom wallet adapter
// npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-phantom
import { PhantomWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom';

const getSVMSigner = async () => {
  const phantom = new PhantomWalletAdapter();
  await phantom.connect();
  return phantom;
};
```
</CodeGroup>

### Finalizing the Client Initialization
Now, pass the signers and your optional configuration options into your `SkipClient` instance:

```ts
const skipClient = new SkipClient({
  getCosmosSigner,
  getEVMSigner,
  getSVMSigner,
  // ...configOptions,
});
```
</Step> <Step title="Query Basic Info">

With your client initialized, you can query balances, supported chains and assets.

<CodeGroup>

```ts List of Supported Chains
// returns a Chain[] of all supported Cosmos mainnet chains
const cosmosChains = await skipClient.chains();

// include EVM and SVM chains
const allChains = await skipClient.chains({
  includeEVM: true,
  includeSVM: true,
});

// only show testnet chains
const testnetChains = await skipClient.chains({
  onlyTestnets: true
});
```

```ts Map of Supported Assets
// returns `Record<string, Asset[]>
const assets = await skipClient.assets({
  includeEvmAssets: true,
  includeSvmAssets: true,
});

// get assets filtered by chain ID
const assets = await client.assets({
  chainID: 'cosmoshub-4'
  includeCW20Assets: true,
})
```

```ts Map of Token Balances
// returns a map of assets by chain ID
const balances = await skipClient.balances({
  "chains": {
    "137": {
      address: "0x24a9267cE9e0a8F4467B584FDDa12baf1Df772B5",
      denoms: [
        "polygon-native",
        "0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359"
      ]
    },
    "osmosis-1": {
      address: "osmo12xufazw43lanl8dkvf3l7y9zzm8n3zswftw2yc",
      denoms: [
        "uosmo"
      ]
    }
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>


</Step> <Step title="Get a Route">

Once you've selected your source and destination chains and tokens, you can generate a route and get a quote. See it in context [here](https://github.com/skip-mev/skip-go-example/blob/d68ec668ebaa230325ad31658b547bd27c42ac49/pages/index.tsx#L46).

<CodeGroup>
```ts Swap ATOM for OSMO
const route = await skipClient.route({
  amountIn: "1000000", // Desired amount in smallest denomination (e.g., uatom)
  sourceAssetDenom: "uatom",
  sourceAssetChainID: "cosmoshub-4",
  destAssetDenom: "uosmo",
  destAssetChainID: "osmosis-1",
  cumulativeAffiliateFeeBPS: '0',
});
```
```ts Swap ETH for TIA
const route = await skipClient.route({
  amountOut: "1000000", // Desired amount out
  sourceAssetDenom: "ethereum-native",
  sourceAssetChainID: "1", // Ethereum mainnet chain ID
  destAssetDenom: "utia",
  destAssetChainID: "celestia",
  smartRelay: true,
  smartSwapOptions: {
    splitRoutes: true,
    evmSwaps: true
  },
});
```
```ts Transfer USDC from Solana to Noble
const route = await skipClient.route({
  sourceAssetDenom: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
  sourceAssetChainID: "solana",
  destAssetDenom: "uusdc",
  destAssetChainID: "noble-1",
  amountIn: "1000000",
  smartRelay: true
});
      ```
</CodeGroup>

</Step> <Step title="Get Required Addresses">

After generating a route, you need to provide user addresses for the required chains. The `route.requiredChainAddresses` array lists the chain IDs for which addresses are needed.

 <Warning>
 **Only use addresses your user can sign for.**
 Funds could get stuck in any address you provide, including intermediate chains in certain failure conditions. Ensure your user can sign for each address you provide. 
See [Cross-chain Failure Cases](../advanced-transfer/handling-cross-chain-failure-cases) for more details.
</Warning>

We recommend storing the user's addresses and creating a function like [`getAddress`](https://github.com/skip-mev/skip-go-example/blob/c55d9208bb46fbf1a4934000e7ec4196d8ccdca4/pages/index.tsx#L99) that retrieves the address based on the chain ID. 

```ts
// get user addresses for each requiredChainAddress to execute the route
  const userAddresses = await Promise.all(
  route.requiredChainAddresses.map(async (chainID) => ({
    chainID,
    address: await getAddress(chainID),
  }))
);
```

</Step> <Step title="Execute the Route">

Once you have a route, you can execute it in a single function call by passing in the route, the user addresses for at least the chains the route includes, and optional callback functions. This also registers the transaction for tracking.

```ts
await skipClient.executeRoute({
  route,
  userAddresses,
  // Executes after all of the operations triggered by a user's signature complete.
  // For multi-tx routes that require multiple user signatures, this will be called once for each tx in sequence
  onTransactionCompleted: async (chainID, txHash, status) => {
    console.log(
      `Route completed with tx hash: ${txHash} & status: ${status.state}`
    );
  },
  // called after the transaction that the user signs gets broadcast on chain
  onTransactionBroadcast: async ({ txHash, chainID }) => {
    console.log(`Transaction broadcasted with tx hash: ${txHash}`);
  },
  // called after the transaction that the user signs is successfully registered for tracking
  onTransactionTracked: async ({ txHash, chainID }) => {
    console.log(`Transaction tracked with tx hash: ${txHash}`);
  },
  // called after the user signs a transaction
  onTransactionSigned: async ({ txHash, chainID }) => {
    console.log(`Transaction signed with tx hash: ${txHash}`);
  },
  // validate gas balance on each chain
  onValidateGasBalance: async ({ chainID, txIndex, status }) => {
    console.log(`Validating gas balance for chain ${chainID}...`);
  },
});
```

For routes that consist of multiple transactions, this will monitor each transaction until it completes, then generate the transaction for the next step and prompt the user to sign it.

<Info>
Alternatively, the route object allows you to generate, sign, and submit messages individually. You can also implement your own solutions for any or all of these steps. For more details on these lower-level functions, refer to `skipClient.messages`, `skipClient.signMultiChainMessageDirect`, and `skipClient.submitTransaction`.
</Info>


</Step><Step title="Transaction Tracking">

Once the user has signed a transaction to execute a cross-chain action, you can track it with:

- `skipClient.trackTransaction`: Requests tracking for a transaction that's already been submitted to the network through an RPC, using the transaction hash
- `skipClient.submitTransaction`: Publishes the signed transaction to the network & begins tracking the cross-chain actions this transaction produces

After you've used one of these two functions to kick-off realtime tracking for a cross-chain action, you can request the current status of the transaction using `skipClient.transactionStatus`.

We also provide a `waitForTransaction` helper function that hangs until the entire cross-chain action flow has completed, which you can use instead of configuring your own polling via `transactionStatus`.
