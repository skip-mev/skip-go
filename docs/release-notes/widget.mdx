### Gas on Receive Feature

*   **Gas on Receive (v3.14.0+):** Intelligent gas management feature that helps users obtain native gas tokens on destination chains during cross-chain swaps. Prevents users from getting "stuck" with assets they can't use due to lacking gas for future transactions. The widget auto-detects insufficient gas balances and shows a toggle for users to enable gas top-up routes. Supports Cosmos chains (0.10 USD) and EVM L2 chains (2.00 USD).

### Visual Widget Builder Launch

We're excited to announce the launch of **[studio.skip.build](https://studio.skip.build)** - our new interactive widget builder.

**Key Features:**
*   **Visual Configuration:** Experiment with themes, colors, and settings through an intuitive interface
*   **Live Preview:** See your changes in real-time before implementing them in code
*   **Asset & Route Testing:** Test different asset combinations and routing scenarios
*   **Code Generation:** Generate the exact props needed for your widget implementation

This tool significantly reduces integration time and helps developers create the perfect widget experience for their users without trial and error in their development environment.

### Transaction Signing Enhancement

*   Added `batchSignTxs` prop to control transaction signing behavior. When enabled (default: true), all transactions in a multi-transaction route are signed upfront.

## Recent Key Updates (Spring 2025)

The Skip Go Widget has seen several improvements focusing on core functionality, user experience, and developer integration.

*   **Updated Core Client Dependency:** The widget now utilizes `@skip-go/client` v1.x. This update brings underlying improvements in efficiency and API consistency from the client library.
*   **User Interface and Experience:**
    *   Swap settings changes now trigger an automatic refetch of route information.
    *   Display of asset amounts and number formatting has been refined for better clarity.
    *   The "Signature Required" prompt is now hidden after a transaction is signed.
    *   Improved the display of estimated transaction fees, providing a more transparent breakdown of potential costs for all routes.
*   **Developer Integration:**
    *   **New Visual Widget Builder:** Launched [studio.skip.build](https://studio.skip.build) - an interactive tool that allows developers to visually configure widget settings, customize themes, test different asset combinations, and preview changes in real-time before implementing them in code.
    *   Introduced an `onSourceAndDestinationSwapped` callback, allowing integrators to add custom logic when users switch the source and destination assets.
