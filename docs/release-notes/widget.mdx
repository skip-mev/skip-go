## Recent Key Updates (Spring 2025)

The Skip Go Widget has seen several improvements focusing on core functionality, user experience, and developer integration.

*   **Updated Core Client Dependency:** The widget now utilizes `@skip-go/client` v1.x. This update brings underlying improvements in efficiency and API consistency from the client library.
*   **User Interface and Experience:**
    *   Swap settings changes now trigger an automatic refetch of route information.
    *   Display of asset amounts and number formatting has been refined for better clarity.
    *   The "Signature Required" prompt is now hidden after a transaction is signed.
    *   Improved the display of estimated transaction fees, providing a more transparent breakdown of potential costs for all routes.
*   **Developer Integration:**
    *   Introduced an `onSourceAndDestinationSwapped` callback, allowing integrators to add custom logic when users switch the source and destination assets.
