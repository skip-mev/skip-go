## May 2025
- **Improved Cross-Chain Composability:** Execute EVM swaps immediately following a Eureka cross-chain transfer, enabling more sophisticated multi-step routes.
- **Enhanced Fee Transparency:** Fees associated with Eureka operations are now clearly displayed within the `estimated_fees` array in API responses from the `/v2/fungible/route` endpoint, providing better cost predictability. For example:
  ```json
  "estimated_fees": [
    {
      "fee_type": "SMART_RELAY",
      "bridge_id": "EUREKA",
      "amount": "76099736314413",
      "usd_amount": "0.20",
      "origin_asset": {
        "denom": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
        "chain_id": "1",
        "symbol": "WETH",
        "name": "Wrapped Ether"
        // ... other asset details (like decimals, logo_uri etc.)
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  ([See API Docs](/api-reference/prod/fungible/post-v2fungibleroute) for full response structures from the `/v2/fungible/route` endpoint.)
- **LayerZero and Stargate Integration:** Expanded cross-chain capabilities with the integration of LayerZero and Stargate protocols. This integration adds support for a wide variety of new assets, including USDT, USDe, and ZRO.
  
  **Usage:**
  - **REST API:** Include `"layer_zero"` and/or `"stargate"` in the `experimental_features` array in your POST request to `/v2/fungible/route`.
    ```json
    {
      "source_asset_denom": "uatom",
      "source_asset_chain_id": "cosmoshub-4",
      "dest_asset_denom": "uusdc",
      "dest_asset_chain_id": "noble-1",
      "amount_in": "1000000",
      "experimental_features": ["layer_zero", "stargate"]
    }
    ```
  
  - **Client Library:** Add these features to the `experimentalFeatures` parameter.
    ```typescript
    import { route } from '@skip-go/client';
    
    const response = await route({
      sourceAssetDenom: "uatom",
      sourceAssetChainId: "cosmoshub-4",
      destAssetDenom: "uusdc",
      destAssetChainId: "noble-1",
      amountIn: "1000000",
      experimentalFeatures: ["layer_zero", "stargate"]
    });
    ```
  
  - **Widget Integration:** Add LayerZero and Stargate to the `experimentalFeatures` array in the `routeConfig` prop of the Skip Widget component.
    ```jsx
    import { Widget } from '@skip-go/widget';
    
    <Widget
      routeConfig={{
        experimentalFeatures: ["layer_zero", "stargate"]
      }}
    />
    ```

### Status Endpoint Enhancement (Late May)
- **Transaction Timestamp Information:** Added `on_chain_at` field to individual transaction detail objects (such as `send_tx`, `receive_tx`, `acknowledge_tx`, `execute_tx`) found within the specific transfer type objects (e.g., `ibc_transfer`, `cctp_transfer`, `axelar_transfer`) in the status endpoint response. This field provides RFC3339 formatted UTC timestamps of when each specific transaction landed on its respective chain.

## April 2025
- **Eureka Protocol Enhancements:**
    - Native token wrapping (e.g., ETH to WETH) is now supported within Eureka cross-chain transfers, with improved fee handling for routes involving native ETH.
    - Eureka Protocol now officially supports transfers to and from Ethereum Mainnet and the Cosmos Hub.
