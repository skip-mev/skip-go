## May 2025
- **Improved Cross-Chain Composability:** Execute EVM swaps immediately following a Eureka cross-chain transfer, enabling more sophisticated multi-step routes.
- **Enhanced Fee Transparency:** Fees associated with Eureka operations are now clearly displayed within the estimated transaction fees for better cost predictability.
- **LayerZero and Stargate Integration:** Expanded cross-chain capabilities with the integration of LayerZero and Stargate protocols.
- **Broader Asset Support:** This integration adds support for a wide variety of new assets, with notable examples including USDT, USDe, and ZRO.

### Status Endpoint Enhancement (Late May)
- **Transaction Timestamp Information:** Added `on_chain_at` field to individual transaction detail objects (such as `send_tx`, `receive_tx`, `acknowledge_tx`, `execute_tx`) found within the specific transfer type objects (e.g., `ibc_transfer`, `cctp_transfer`, `axelar_transfer`) in the status endpoint response. This field provides RFC3339 formatted UTC timestamps of when each specific transaction landed on its respective chain.

## April 2025
- **Eureka Protocol Enhancements:**
    - Native token wrapping (e.g., ETH to WETH) is now supported within Eureka cross-chain transfers, with improved fee handling for routes involving native ETH.
    - Eureka Protocol now officially supports transfers to and from Ethereum Mainnet and the Cosmos Hub.
