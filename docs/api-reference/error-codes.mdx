---

This document provides a reference for the various error codes and status messages you may encounter when using Skip Go's APIs. Understanding these codes is essential for handling API responses correctly and providing accurate feedback to users.

## Transaction Status Codes

These codes represent the overall status of a transaction being processed or tracked by the Skip Go API.

| Status                  | Description                                                                 | Notes                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STATE_UNKNOWN`           | The status of the transaction is unknown.                                   | Should be treated as an **error state**.                                                               |
| `STATE_SUBMITTED`         | The transaction has been submitted to the blockchain network.               |                                                                                                      |
| `STATE_PENDING`           | The transaction is in progress and waiting to be processed.                 |                                                                                                      |
| `STATE_RECEIVED`          | The transaction has been received by the blockchain network.                |                                                                                                      |
| `STATE_COMPLETED`         | (Internal transitional state)                                               | This state is resolved to `STATE_COMPLETED_SUCCESS` or `STATE_COMPLETED_ERROR` before API response.  |
| `STATE_ABANDONED`         | The transaction was abandoned, often due to timeout (e.g., IBC relayer).    | Tracking timed out. Not necessarily a permanent transaction failure; may be retriable.             |
| `STATE_COMPLETED_SUCCESS` | The transaction has completed successfully.                                 | This is the **only** status that definitively indicates successful end-to-end transaction completion. |
| `STATE_COMPLETED_ERROR`   | The transaction has completed but encountered errors.                         |                                                                                                      |
| `STATE_PENDING_ERROR`     | The transaction encountered errors while being processed.                   |                                                                                                      |
