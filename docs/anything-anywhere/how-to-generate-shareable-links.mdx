title: "How to Generate Shareable Links"
description: "This guide provides step-by-step instructions to generate go.skip.build shareable links."
---

### Quick Start

1. Go to [https://go.skip.build](https://go.skip.build)
2. Modify the source/destination chains and assets to set the default route (optional)
3. Click the "Share" button

4. Voila, you're done! The sharable link is now copied to your clipboard for you to embed on your website for an easy onboarding/deposit experience, to tweet about your bags, or to simply share it with your friends!

### Advanced Configuration Instructions

Instead of creating a route and sharing it via [https://go.skip.build](https://go.skip.build), you can create a sharable link with the following parameters of your choice: `src_chain`, `src_asset`, `dest_chain`, `dest_asset`, `amount_in`, and `amount_out`.

* To see supported chains, you can use [https://api.skip.build/v2/info/chains](https://api.skip.build/v2/info/chains) see [docs](/api-reference/info/get-v2infochains)
* To see supported assets, you can use [https://api.skip.build/v2/fungible/assets](https://api.skip.build/v2/fungible/assets) see [docs](api-reference/fungible/get-v2fungibleassets)

**Query Base URL:** [https://go.skip.build/](https://go.skip.build/)

**Query Parameters:**

* `src_chain`: The source chain ID from which the asset is being transferred.
* `src_asset`: The asset or token **denom** to transfer or swap originating from the source chain.  
   * **Note:** Must be a valid asset on the specified `src_chain`.
* `dest_chain`: The destination chain ID to which the asset is being transferred.
* `dest_asset`: The asset or token **denom** that will be received on the destination chain.  
   * **Note:** Must be a valid asset on the specified `dest_chain`.
* `amount_in` (Optional): The amount of the asset being transferred from the source chain.  
   * **Note:** If provided along with `amount_out`, only `amount_in` will be used.
* `amount_out` (Optional): The amount of the asset to be received on the destination chain.  
   * **Note:** If provided along with `amount_in`, only `amount_in` will be used.

**Example Shareable Link:** [https://go.skip.build?src\_chain=cosmoshub-4&src\_asset=uatom&dest\_chain=pacific-1&dest\_asset=usei&amount\_in=1](https://go.skip.build?src%5Fchain=cosmoshub-4&src%5Fasset=uatom&dest%5Fchain=pacific-1&dest%5Fasset=usei&amount%5Fin=1)

### Helpful Tips

* Ensure that the `src_chain` and `dest_chain` values are valid and supported by the platform.
* The `src_asset` must be a valid asset on the specified `src_chain`, and the `dest_asset` must be a valid asset on the specified `dest_chain`.
* If both `amount_in` and `amount_out` are provided, only `amount_in` will be used.
* If `src_asset` or `dest_asset` is not provided or found, it will default to the chain's native asset.
