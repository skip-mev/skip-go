### Background

The `experimental_features` parameter on `/route` and `/msgs_direct` gives us a consistent mechanism for rolling out new features to the folks who want to adopt them ASAP in an "opt-in" fashion, without threatening to destabilize power users who might want the new hottness. 

_(Of course, we avoid shipping changes that are technically breaking no matter what. But we've found that even additive changes can break some integrators)._

We will probably auto-activate most features that we soft launch in `experimental_features` within a few weeks or months of the initial launch -- especially when the feature makes a strict improvement to end user UX (e.g. adding a new DEX or bridge). 

The `experimental_features` parameter accepts an array of strings, where each string identifies a feature. The rest of this doc describes each experimental feature currently in prod, when the feature will become opt-out (rather than opt-in), and gives the feature's identifier. 

### Hyperlane ("HYPERLANE")
