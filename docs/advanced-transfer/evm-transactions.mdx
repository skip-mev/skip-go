title: 'EVM Transactions Intro'
description: 'This doc covers how to interact with the EvmTx type returned by the Skip Go API'
---

## Intro

- When a user needs to transfer or swap from an EVM chain (e.g. Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc...), the Skip Go API will return an `EvmTx` type for the developer to pass to the user for signing
- Unlike CosmosSDK transactions, EVM transactions do not have a notion of messages, so this object doesn't correspond 1-to-1 to a "message", which might be a more familiar notion to Cosmos developers
- This doc is intended for CosmosSDK developers who aren't already familiar with the concepts of transaction construction in the EVM and need to use `EvmTx` to help their users move from/to EVM chains.

## `EvmTx` Data Structure

The EvmTx has 4 fields that the developer needs to understand:

- `to`: The address of the smart contract or externally owned account (EOA) with which this transaction interacts, as a hex-string prefixed with 0x (e.g. 0xfc05aD74C6FE2e7046E091D6Ad4F660D2A159762)
- `value`: The amount of `wei` this transaction sends to the contract its interacting with (1 ETH = 1^18 WEI)
- `data`: The calldata this transaction uses to call the smart contract it interacts with, as a hex string. The data bytes will be interpreted according to the application-binary-interface (ABI) of the contract that's being interacted with. If this field is empty, it means the transaction is sending funds to an address, rather than calling a contract.
- `required_erc20_approvals`: The permissions that must be granted to a specific smart contract to spend or transfer a certain amount of their ERC-20 tokens on behalf of the end user. This allows smart contracts to execute expressive flows that may involve moving some amount of the user's ERC-20 tokens
  - If this field is non-empty, the approval must be granted, signed, and submitted before the `EvmTx` populated by the other fields in the response can be submitted to the network. Otherwise, it will fail to execute with a permission error.
  - Skip's `ERC20Approval` object has 3 fields that define approval:
    _ `token_contract`: The address of the ERC-20 token on which the approval is granted
    _ `spender`: The address of the contract to which the approval will grant spend authority \* `amount`: The amount of `token_contract` tokens the approval will grant the `spender` to spend
  - Check out EIP-2612 for more information on ERC-20 approvals.
- `chain_id`: This is the same as in the Cosmos context (simply an identifier for the chain), but it's an int instead of a string

## Example constructing & signing an EVM Transaction

### 1\. Install Signing Library and Skip Library

To enable EVM transactions in your application, first install an EVM developer library. The most popular options are:

- [viem](https://viem.sh/)
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
- [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/)

The code snippets below use viem.

```Shell Shell
npm i viem
npm i @skip-go/client
```

### 1\. Initialize the `SkipClient` client with the EVM `WalletClient` object

All 3 libraries mentioned above allow you to create WalletClient "signer" objects that:

- Use an RPC provider under the hood to query the chain for necessary data to create transactions (e.g. nonce, gas price, etc...)
- Expose an API that allows constructing, signing, and broadcasting transactions

You need to set up the `getEVMSigner` function in the `SkipClient` constructor to initialize this signer object for the a given EVM chain.

For example, with Viem, we do the following:

```TypeScript TypeScript
import { createWalletClient, custom} from 'viem';
import * as chains from 'viem/chains';
import { SkipClient } from '@skip-go/client';

const
const skipClient = new SkipClient({
  getEVMSigner: async (chainID) => {
    const chain = extractChain({
  		chains: Object.values(chains),
  		id: parseInt(chainID)
    });
    const evmWalletClient = createWalletClient({
  		chain: chain,
  		transport: custom(window.ethereum!)
  	});
    return evmWalletClient;
  }
});
```

### 2\. Request Route using `SkipClient` and get required chain

Next, request your route as normal:

```Typescript TypeScript
const route = await skipClient.route({
  amountIn: "1000",
  sourceAssetDenom: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
  sourceAssetChainID: "1",
  destAssetDenom: "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831",
  destAssetChainID: "42161",
  smartRelay: true,
  smartSwapOptions: {
    splitRoutes: true
  }
};

```

### 3\. Get User Addresses for all Required Chains

Use the route to determine the chains for which you need to supply a user address (the source, destination, and all intermediate chains that require a recovery address for receiving tokens in case of a failure)

```TypeScript TypeScript
let userAddresses = []
const requiredAddresses = route.requiredChainAddresses;
// iterate over chain IDs for chains that require addresses
for (const chainID of requiredAddresses) {
  	// Check that the chain is an EVM chain
    if (parseInt(chainID)) {
      // use signer library to get address from wallet
      const chain = extractChain({
        chains: Object.values(chains),
        id: parseInt(chainID)
      });
      const evmWalletClient = createWalletClient({
        chain: chain,
        transport: custom(window.ethereum!)
      });
      const [address] = await client.requestAddresses();
      // add to map
      userAddresses.append({address: address, chainID: chainID})
    } else {
      // handle cosmos and SVM wallets -- not shown
    }

});
return evmWalletClient;
}

```

### 4\. Execute the Route using `SkipClient`

Finally, you can use `SkipClient.executeRoute` to prompt the user to sign the approval(s) and transaction, and submit the transaction on chain.

```TypeScript TypeScript
await skipClient.executeRoute({
  route:route,
  userAddresses: userAddresses
});
```
