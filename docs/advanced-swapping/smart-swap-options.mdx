## Introduction

Smart Swap refers to a broad range of functionality we're building out to improve swap speed, price, and customization. 

At this time, the main use case for smart swap is improving trade execution price by enabling third-party routers (e.g. Hallswap) and trade splitting. But much more is on the way!

This doc covers: 

* All the different features Smart Swap enables
* Describes how to use each of them


 <Warning>
 **`@skip-router` 4.0.0+ required**
 
 If you're using the deprecated `@skip-router` library, you must use v4.0.0 or later to use Smart Swap.

 We advise all integators to use the new `@skip-go/core` [TypeScript Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skip-go/core), which is being actively maintained and developed.
</Warning>

## How to Use Smart Swap

All Smart Swap features are controlled with a single configuration object: 

1. `@skip-go/core` Package: `smartSwapOptions` object passed in`SkipRouter.route` options `SkipRouter.msgsDirect` options
2. REST API: `smart_swap_options` parameter passed in `/v2/fungible/route` and `/v2/fungible/msgs_direct`

Read on for more info about the individual features and how to use each of them.

(For the rest of this doc, examples will show how to use Smart Swap with the `@skip-go/core` library by configuring it on `SkipRouter.route`. The only changes you'll notice between this context and the REST API is naming conventions)

## Smart Swap Features

### Feature: Use 3rd-party routers to improve price

#### What is it

The Skip Go API searches over multiple 1st and 3rd-party routers to find the route that gives you best execution. This has a chance of improving the price at which your user's swap executes. 

The swap routers currently supported are:

1. Skip Go API's in-house Router
2. Hallswap's Dex Aggregator
3. Osmosis's Sidecar Query Service (SQS) (Used in the Osmosis frontend)

#### How to use it

Just pass the `smartSwapOptions` object into your route request. You're not required to activate a particular flag. 



```text TypeScript
const route = await skipClient.route({
  smartSwapOptions: {}, // smart swap object
  sourceAssetDenom: "uusdc",
  sourceAssetChainID: "noble-1",
  destAssetDenom: "utia",
  destAssetChainID: "celestia",
  amountIn: "1000000", // 1 uusdc
  cumulativeAffiliateFeeBPS: "0"
}
```

That's it! Skip Go API will now consider all routers we have available and give your user the best one. 

### Feature: Route Splitting

#### What is it

Route splitting is a technique in swap optimization where a user's trade is split into several parts and swapped through separate pools. It can help lower price impact and increase output for the user, compared to swapping with a single route. This technique is especially effective when one or both of the tokens the user is swapping is a commonly paired asset on a DEX (e.g. OSMO is paired with almost everything on Osmosis). 

#### How to use it

Just pass the `splitRoutes` flag in the `smartSwapOptions` object.



```text TypeScript
const route = await skipClient.route({
  smartSwapOptions: {
    splitRoutes: true
  }, // smart swap object
  sourceAssetDenom: "uusdc",
  sourceAssetChainID: "noble-1",
  destAssetDenom: "utia",
  destAssetChainID: "celestia",
  amountIn: "1000000", // 1 uusdc
  cumulativeAffiliateFeeBPS: "0"
}
```

### Feature: EVM Swaps

#### What is it

The API supports swapping on an EVM chain, followed by a CCTP/Axelar transfer over to the Cosmos ecosystem. This allows a user to onboard on to your IBC connected chain in 1 transaction from a broad range of EVM assets, including the memecoins retail loves to hold!

Currently, the API supports swapping on official Uniswap V3 deployments on the following chains (and their respective chain IDs):

1. Ethereum (1)
2. Polygon (137)
3. Optimism (10)
4. Arbitrum One (42161)
5. Base (8453)
6. BNB Chain (56)
7. Avalanche (43114)
8. Blast (81457)
9. Celo (42220) - SOON

#### How to use it

Just set the `evmSwaps` flag to true in the `smartSwapOptions` object. If using the deprecated `@skip-router` library, you must be on version 5.1.0 or above (we advise you migrate over to `@skip-go/core` as soon as possible).


<CodeGroup>
```Typescript TypeScript
const route = await skipClient.route({
  sourceAssetDenom: "arbitrum-native",
  sourceAssetChainID: "42161",
  destAssetDenom: "ibc/8E27BA2D5493AF5636760E354E46004562C46AB7EC0CC4C1CA14E9E20E2545B5",
  destAssetChainID: "dydx-mainnet-1",
  amountIn: "10000000000000000000",
  cumulativeAffiliateFeeBPS: "0",
  smartRelay: true,
  smartSwapOptions: {
    evmSwaps: true
  },
}
```

```JSON JSON
{
  "amount_in": "10000000000000000000",
  "source_asset_denom": "arbitrum-native",
  "source_asset_chain_id": "42161",
  "dest_asset_denom": "ibc/8E27BA2D5493AF5636760E354E46004562C46AB7EC0CC4C1CA14E9E20E2545B5",
  "dest_asset_chain_id": "dydx-mainnet-1",
  "cumulative_affiliate_fee_bps": "0",
  "allow_multi_tx": true,
  "smart_relay": true,
  "smart_swap_options": {
  	"evm_swaps": true
  },
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### What to expect from the route response

When an EVM swap occurs in a route, a new operation type `evm_swap` is returned in the array of `operations` in the `v2/route` and `v2/msgs_direct` responses. If your API usage follows the `v2/route` then `v2/msgs` call pattern, this new operation type must be passed to the `v2/msgs` endpoint, so make sure you are on the latest [Skip Go Core version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skip-go/core) and/or are decoding the operation properly. The `evm_swap` operation type is as follows:

<CodeGroup>

```text TypeScript
export type EvmSwap = {
  inputToken: string;
  amountIn: string;
  swapCalldata: string;
  amountOut: string;
  fromChainID: string;
  denomIn: string;
  denomOut: string;
  swapVenues: SwapVenue[];
}
```

```JSON JSON
{
  "evm_swap": {
    "input_token": "ox",   // string (token contract address if an ERC20 token, blank if native)
    "amount_in": "100",    // string
    "swap_calldata": "0x", // string
    "amount_out": "123",   // string
    "from_chain_id": "1",  // string
    "denom_in": "0x",      // string
    "denom_out": "0x",     // string
    "swap_venues": [],     // []swap_venue
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### What to expect differently from the /msgs and /status responses

Nothing new in particular! The `msg_type` used for EVM swaps is the same `evm_tx` type used for all of our EVM transactions. Similarly, there is no new `transfer_event` type to be aware of, since the swap is atomic with the bridging action (Axelar or CCTP), the same types are used (`axelar_transfer_info` and `cctp_transfer_info` respectively).

### Response Changes using Smart Swap

We've added a new `swapType` called `SmartSwapExactCoinIn` you can expect to be returned in the `routeResponse` and `msgsDirectResponse` to take advantage of the new capabilities Smart Swaps offers! This new swap type has fields that allow for multiple routes, across multiple swap venues. 

* **Note:** this new `SmartSwapExactCoinIn` type will currently only be returned if the route provided back is a split route.



```type type
export type SmartSwapExactCoinIn = {
  swapVenue: SwapVenue;
  swapRoutes: SwapRoute[];
};

export type SwapRoute = {
  swapAmountIn: string;
  denomIn: string;
  swapOperations: SwapOperation[];
};
```
