## How do I fix the "Buffer is not defined" error?

If you see a 'Buffer is not defined' error when using @skip-go/widget, it's likely because the widget depends on Node.js modules that aren't available in the browser. To fix this, you'll need to add polyfills for those modules.
Here are some polyfill plugins for common environments:

- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin)
- [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-polyfill-node)
- [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-node-polyfills)
- [ESBuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugins-node-modules-polyfill)

## Should I put the widget inside a container with a fixed size?

It is recommended to wrap the widget with a container element that has a fixed size. This helps to prevent layout shifting as the widget uses the shadow-dom (which needs to be rendered client-side). We recommend a height of `640px` and a width of `500px`.
