## How do I fix the "Buffer is not defined" error?

If you see a 'Buffer is not defined' error when using @skip-go/widget, it's likely because the widget depends on Node.js modules that aren't available in the browser. To fix this, you'll need to add polyfills for those modules.
Here are some polyfill plugins for common environments:

- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin)
- [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-polyfill-node)
- [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-node-polyfills)
- [ESBuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugins-node-modules-polyfill)

## Should I put the widget inside a container with a fixed size?

It is recommended to wrap the widget with a container element that has a fixed size. This helps to prevent layout shifting as the widget uses the shadow-dom (which needs to be rendered client-side). We recommend a height of `640px` and a width of `500px`.

## Can I use Safe Multisig wallets with the Skip Go widget?

Yes! Safe wallets (the popular multisig wallet at https://app.safe.global) can be used with the Skip Go widget through wallet providers that support importing Safe wallets:

* **Rabby Wallet**: Supports importing and using Safe wallets
* **WalletConnect**: Supports connecting Safe wallets through WalletConnect protocol

Both options allow you to use your Safe wallet for multi-chain swaps and transfers through the Skip Go widget.

**Important:** When using Safe wallets for cross-chain transactions, ensure that your Safe wallet is deployed on all relevant destination chains before initiating transfers. Safe wallets use deterministic addresses, but the wallet contract must be deployed on each chain where you plan to receive funds.

## Why am I getting CORS error / blocked by CORS policy?

If you're seeing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when using the Skip Go widget, it means your domain needs to be whitelisted to access Skip's API endpoints.

To resolve this issue, please get your domain whitelisted by submitting a support ticket in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/interchain).
