title: 'Web Component'
---

For non-React applications, the Skip Go `Widget` is available as a web component.


# Installation

You can import the web component in two ways:

## 1. NPM

```ts
import('@skip-go/widget-web-component');
```

<Info>
Note: Ensure Node has sufficient memory allocated: `CopyNODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=32384`
This can be added to npm scripts in `package.json`, a `.env file`, or used when running Node directly.
</Info>

## 2. Script Tag or CDN (Recommended)
```html
<body>
  <script
    async
    src="https://unpkg.com/@skip-go/widget-web-component/build/index.js"
    type="module"
  ></script>
</body>
```

## Usage

Props are the same as [`WidgetProps`](./configuration), but passed as attributes in kebab-case. Use strings or stringified objects for complex props.

```tsx
<div style="width:100%; max-width:500px; padding:0 10px;">
  <swap-widget
    theme='{
      "brandColor": "#FF4FFF",
    }'
    default-route='{
      "srcChainId": "osmosis-1",
      "srcAssetDenom": "ibc/1480b8fd20ad5fcae81ea87584d269547dd4d436843c1d20f15e00eb64743ef4"
    }'
  ></swap-widget>
</div>
```

## Performance Considerations
It's recommended to lazy load this component as it comes pre-bundled with all dependencies, which may impact load times, especially in development environments.
