## I'm getting a "Buffer is not defined" error, how do I fix?

If you encounter an error like "Buffer is not defined" when importing and using @skip-go/widget, it may be necessary to polyfill Node.js modules because Skip Go Widget relies on them.

Here are some polyfill plugins for common environments:

- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin),
- [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-polyfill-node),
- [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-node-polyfills),
- [ESBuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugins-node-modules-polyfill)

## I'm getting errors such as `could not resolve "react/jsx-runtime"` after installing the widget, how do I fix?

If you encounter errors such as `could not resolve "react/jsx-runtime"` after installing the widget, you may need to install the peer dependencies.
Some package managers will install peer dependencies by default if they are missing, but others (like yarn) will not.

Try installing the following packages and see if that resolves the issue:

(example using yarn)

```bash
yarn add react react-dom styled-components
```
