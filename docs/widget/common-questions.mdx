## I'm getting a "Buffer is not defined" error, how do I fix?

If you encounter an error like "Buffer is not defined" when importing and using @skip-go/widget, it may be necessary to polyfill Node.js modules because Skip Go Widget relies on them.

Here are some polyfill plugins for common environments:

- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin),
- [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-polyfill-node),
- [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-node-polyfills),
- [ESBuild](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugins-node-modules-polyfill)
