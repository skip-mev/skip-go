# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you though how to easily install and add the Skip Go Widget directly into your app in no time!

## 1. Installation

The `@skip-go/widget` package is an npm package providing a React component for a fully customizable swapping, transferring, and bridging interface using the [Skip Go API](https://skip.build/). To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @skip-go/widget
```

## 2. Use the `SwapWidget` Component

Next, use the `SwapWidget` component to render the swap interface:

```typescript javascript
import { SwapWidget } from '@skip-go/widget';

const SwapPage = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '450px',
        height: '820px',
      }}
    >
      <SwapWidget
        colors={{
          primary: '#FF4FFF',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 3. Configure away!

You're all done with the basic set up! Now that you have the widget integrated, it's time to configure the user experience. You can find all of the configurable component props in [Configuration Options](/widget/configuration-options).
