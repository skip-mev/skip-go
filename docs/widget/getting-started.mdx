# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you though how to Skip Go `SwapWidget` directly to your React app. 

<Info>
Starting from scratch? It's recommended to use a React framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to get up and running quickly.
</Info>

## 1. Installation

<CodeGroup>
```shell NPM
npm install @skip-go/widget
```
```shell Yarn
yarn add @skip-go/widget
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
If you're using `yarn` (or another package manager that doesn't install peer dependencies by default)
you may need to install these peer dependencies as well:

```bash
yarn add react react-dom styled-components
```
</Info>

## 2. Import the `SwapWidget` Component

Next, use the `SwapWidget` component to render the swap interface:

```typescript
import { SwapWidget } from '@skip-go/widget';

const SwapPage = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '450px',
        height: '640px',
      }}
    >
      <SwapWidget
        theme={{
          brandColor: '#FF4FFF',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 3. Configure to Your Needs

Now that you have the widget integrated, it's time to configure the user experience. Find more details on widget configuration [here](./configuration).
