# Overview

# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you though how to integrate the `Widget` into your React app.

<Info>
Starting from scratch? It's recommended to use a React framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to get up and running quickly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">

<CodeGroup>
```shell NPM
npm install @skip-go/widget
```
```shell Yarn
yarn add @skip-go/widget
```
</CodeGroup>
<Info>
If you're using `yarn` (or another package manager that doesn't install peer dependencies by default)
you may need to install these peer dependencies as well:

```bash
  yarn add @tanstack/react-query graz react react-dom viem wagmi
```
</Info>
</Step><Step title="Import the Widget Component">

Next, use the `Widget` component to render the swap interface:

```typescript
import { Widget } from '@skip-go/widget';

const SwapPage = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        maxWidth: '500px',
        padding: '0 10px',
      }}
    >
      <Widget
        theme="light"
        brandColor: '#FF4FFF'
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

</Step><Step title="Configuration">

Now that you have the widget integrated, it's time to configure the user experience. Find more details on widget configuration [here](./configuration).
