# Background

IBC Eureka is the official native implementation of IBC v2.
It leverages the Cosmos Hub and Interchain Labs contracts, relayers, and infrastructure to enable seamless cross-chain user and liquidity mobility.

The following guide explains how to test IBC Eureka's Devnet deployment via a CLI tool developed to interact with IBC Eureka, enabling trust-minimized token transfers between Ethereum and Cosmos chains.
This guide currently shows the steps for transactions between Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and a Cosmos Hub Devnet we spun up for the purpose.

# Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Access to Ethereum and Cosmos endpoints
- Private keys for both chains
- Sepolia ETH for gas fees on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- An ERC20 token on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet

# Installation

        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Keys

<Warning>**Do not use mainnet keys for the testing CLI**</Warning>

Once the CLI is built, the next steps are to set up the Ethereum Sepolia and Cosmos devnet keys and addresses to use. Currently, you'll need to store your private keys for both Cosmos and Ethereum as environment variables.

There are **three** accounts required:

1. `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` - You can retrieve an Ethereum private key from within Metamask by creating a new account > navigating to "Account details" > and pressing "Show private key"
   - To test a transfer from Ethereum Sepolia to the Cosmos Devnet, you'll need to have testnet ETH on this account. You can use any Ethereum Sepolia faucet for this, an example is: [Google Cloud Ethereum Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)
   - You'll also be transferring an ERC20 token. You can use [Token Tool](https://tokentool.bitbond.com/create-token/erc20-token/ethereum-sepolia) to create a new ERC20 token on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and use that in your command to do a Eureka transfer from Sepolia Testnet to Cosmos Devnet.
2. `COSMOS_PRIVATE_KEY` - This will be used as the initiator of a transfer in the other direction. You can retrieve a Cosmos `unarmored-hex` private key by following the following steps:
   1. Installing a node daemon CLI: `simd` or <code><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/gaia">gaiad</a></code>.
   2. Adding keys to the daemon CLI: `gaiad keys add <account-name> --recover`
   3. Entering the BIP-39 mnemonic for the account you want to add. (Remove `--recover` to generate new)
   4. Exporting the unarmored hex: `gaiad keys export <account-name> --unarmored-hex --unsafe`
3. `RELAYER_WALLET` - For devnet, we are providing relayer keys manually. Reach out to the Interchain Labs team, and we will provide the private key for your use.

Once all the necessary private keys are obtained, run the following command to set them as environment variables:

```bash
export ETH_PRIVATE_KEY="your-ethereum-private-key"
export COSMOS_PRIVATE_KEY="your-cosmos-unarmored-hex-private-key"
export RELAYER_WALLET="ask-icl-team-for-the-testing-key"
```

<Note>
  **Note:** All three of the above are hexadecimal private keys, each 64
  characters long.

            ```bash Usage
            go run ./ transfer-from-eth-to-cosmos [amount] [erc20-contract-address] [to-address] [flags]
            ```

            ```bash Example
            go run ./ transfer-from-eth-to-cosmos 1 0xA4ff49eb6E2Ea77d7D8091f1501385078642603f cosmos1u5d4hk8294fs9pq556jxmlju2ceh4jmurcpfv7 \

            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        This will give you a `txHash` in the output.

            ```

            ```bash Example
            go run ./ relay-tx 0xed13b2567a00eae7d0a6c8e24d1cf6342116d1d89d72ff9b52b690cdd3a5dd98 \

            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Transfer tokens back from Cosmos to Ethereum">
        Depending on if the token is native to the chain (uatom for the Cosmos Devnet) or is an IBC'd token from Ethereum Sepolia, the denom to use in the command is as follows:
        1. If IBC transferring a token native to the chain, you can use the denom you expect (uatom) in the command.
        2. If IBC transferring a token that was already IBC transferred from Ethereum, you'll use the IBC denom of the token, beginning with `transfer/08-wasm-0/0x` (from the `balance` command below).

        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash Usage
            go run ./ transfer-from-cosmos-to-eth [amount] [denom] [to-ethereum-address] [flags]
            ```

            ```bash Example (native token)
            go run ./ transfer-from-cosmos-to-eth 1 uatom 0x94B00F484232D55Cc892BbE0b0C1c4a9ad112098
            ```

            ```bash Example (IBC token)
            go run ./ transfer-from-cosmos-to-eth 1 transfer/08-wasm-0/0xa4ff49eb6e2ea77d7d8091f1501385078642603f 0x94B00F484232D55Cc892BbE0b0C1c4a9ad112098
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        This will give you a `txHash` in the output, needed for relaying.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Relay the transaction from Cosmos to Ethereum">
        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash Usage
            go run ./ relay_tx [txHash] [flags]
            ```

            ```bash Example
            go run ./ relay_tx 28D0B356557DC625D62649E7B1E05B8730898389B8D888E9C920BED33429D9EB \
              --eth-rpc="https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com" \
              --cosmos-rpc="https://eureka-devnet-node-01-rpc.dev.skip.build:443"
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        This is the same as the previous relay, but from the format of the `txHash`, the relayer knows in which direction the relay needs to happen.

            go run ./ balance [address] [optional-denom-or-erc20-address] [flags]
            ```
