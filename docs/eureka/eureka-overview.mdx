# IBC Eureka: Fast, Cheap, and Seamless Interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum

## What is IBC Eureka?

IBC Eureka is the canonical implementation of IBC v2 that enables seamless interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem. As a subset of the proven Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Eureka extends the reach of 115+ Cosmos chains to Ethereum (Q1 2025) with support for Layer 2 networks such as Base and Arbitrum or Solana to be added soon.

    Connect your Cosmos chain to Ethereum and other EVM chains with minimal cost and battle-tested security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Compatibility" icon="puzzle">
    If your chain already uses IBC, is connected to the Cosmos Hub and has been onboarded to the Skip API, you can immediately connect to Ethereum through Eureka with no new dependencies.
  </Card>

## Integration Options

There are three components to consider in any Eureka integration:

1. The chain level integration - the underlying connection between blockchains that want to use Eureka
2. The asset level integration - ensuring the assets you care about being imported and exported are set up in the Skip API
3. The interface level integration - how end users will interact with Eureka 

### 1. Chain Level Integration

If you're running a Cosmos-based blockchain, the easiest way to use Eureka is through the Cosmos Hub:

- Requires an IBC (classic) connection to the Cosmos Hub
- No chain upgrade is needed if you're already using IBC
- Users benefit from reduced cost of asset transfers between Eureka-enabled domains through batching
- Chains only need to maintain a single relayer to the Cosmos Hub to reach the entire Eureka and IBC network

If you are interested in a direct Eureka connection to Ethereum, or L2s/ Solana coming later this year, 
please reach out to [Jeremy](https://t.me/NotJeremyLiu) or [Susannah](https://t.me/bigsuse) directly as additional integration work is required.

### 2. Asset Level Integration

For application developers looking to import or export assets across different blockchains:

- Ensure you are set up with the [Skip API](/support-requirements/chain-support-requirements)
- Let us know which assets you want to import/export so we can set up the routing in the API

### 3. Interface Level Integration

To support end-users who need to use the interoperability functionality of Eureka:

- Integrate the [widget](/widget/getting-started) (easiest and fastest integration), or [client library](/client/getting-started) (more customization) to enable your users to interact with Eureka
- The integration provides a one-click experience for users to transfer assets
- Access all IBC-connected chains and Ethereum from a single integration
- Your integration is distributed to 50+ wallets and frontends on day 1, that already use the Skip API
