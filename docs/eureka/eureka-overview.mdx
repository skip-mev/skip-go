# IBC Eureka: Fast, Cheap, and Seamless Interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum

## What is IBC Eureka?

IBC Eureka is the canonical implementation of IBC v2 that enables seamless interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem. As a subset of the proven Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Eureka extends the reach of 115+ Cosmos chains to Ethereum (Q1 2025) with support for Layer 2 networks such as Base and Arbitrum or Solana to be added soon.

    If your chain already uses IBC, is connected to the Cosmos Hub and has been onboarded to the Skip API, you can immediately connect to Ethereum through Eureka with no new dependencies.
