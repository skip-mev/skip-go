# Custom ERC20 Integration

## Overview

In the initial release of [`solidity-ibc-eureka`](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka), receiving a non-native token (e.g., ATOM from Cosmos Hub) deploys a default [`IBCERC20`](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/main/contracts/utils/IBCERC20.sol) contract to represent that token on Ethereum.

Many teams bridging through the Cosmos Hub, however, want ownership and control over their ERC20 contracts on Ethereum. Since `IBCERC20` is managed by the `ICS20Transfer` contract and isn't customizable, direct ownership isn't possible.

To address this, we allow teams to deploy custom ERC20 contractsâ€”provided they implement a simple interface that lets the `ICS20Transfer` contract mint and burn tokens.

## Benefits

The benefits of this approach include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom Metadata" icon="tag">
    Customize metadata and token naming on deployment. Tokens will not initially be named `ibc/transfer/channel-0...` and can be represented with the name they are recognized by.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contract Verification" icon="shield-check">
    Easier contract verification on Etherscan. Each project can easily verify the ERC20 contract deployed for their project to increase trust by associating the token with the official project domain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Improved CEX Listing" icon="dollar-sign">
    This is likely to result in easier CEX listing and generally increased trust in the bridged asset.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Control" icon="gear">
    Complete ownership and control over the ERC20 contract representing your token on Ethereum.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Requirements

To replace the default `IBCERC20`, your custom ERC20 contract must implement the [`IMintableAndBurnable`](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IMintableAndBurnable.sol) interface:

```solidity
interface IMintableAndBurnable {
    /// @notice Mint new tokens to the Escrow contract
    /// @dev This function can only be called by an authorized contract (e.g., ICS20)
    /// @dev This function needs to allow minting tokens to the Escrow contract
    /// @param mintAddress Address to mint tokens to
    /// @param amount Amount of tokens to mint
    function mint(address mintAddress, uint256 amount) external;

    /// @notice Burn tokens from the Escrow contract
    /// @dev This function can only be called by an authorized contract (e.g., ICS20)
    /// @dev This function needs to allow burning of tokens from the Escrow contract
    /// @param mintAddress Address to burn tokens from
    /// @param amount Amount of tokens to burn
    function burn(address mintAddress, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

For an example implementation of this interface, you can refer to the [`RefImplIBCERC20.sol`](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/main/test/solidity-ibc/utils/RefImplIBCERC20.sol) contract in the `solidity-ibc-eureka` repository.

### Access Control Requirements

These functions must be callable by the proxy of the `ICS20Transfer` contract:

- **Mainnet**: `0xa348CfE719B63151F228e3C30EB424BA5a983012`

Token teams may implement access controls or rate limits as needed, as long as the `ICS20Transfer` proxy can still perform mint and burn operations.

<Note>
  The interface remains open to iteration based on community feedback.
</Note>

## Registering a Custom ERC20

The `ICS20Transfer` contract includes a permissioned method for registering a custom ERC20 via the [`setCustomERC20`](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/bce3a4a0de85697607815e2f7c9d9e2a8a508cd3/contracts/ICS20Transfer.sol#L264C14-L264C28) function.

### Prerequisites

Only addresses assigned the `ERC20_CUSTOMIZER_ROLE` can call this function. This role is established by the protocol's security council and administered by the Eureka Ops multi-sig. To request registration of your custom ERC20 contract, [join our Discord](https://skip.build/discord) and open a support ticket.

### Critical Timing Requirement

<Warning>
  `setCustomERC20` must be called **before** the first IBC transfer of the token to the chain where the custom ERC20 is deployed. Once the initial transfer is made, the ERC20 mapping becomes immutable.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

If you're an asset issuer looking to deploy a custom ERC20 contract for your token on Ethereum:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement the Interface">
    Deploy your custom ERC20 contract that implements the `IMintableAndBurnable` interface with proper access controls for the `ICS20Transfer` proxy. For an example, see the [reference implementation](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/main/test/solidity-ibc/utils/RefImplIBCERC20.sol) in the `solidity-ibc-eureka` repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Registration">
    [Join our Discord](https://skip.build/discord) and open a support ticket to request registration of your custom ERC20 contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and Launch">
    Verify your contract on Etherscan for greater transparency. For assistance, see the [Etherscan Contract Verification page](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract). Once verified, start bridging your token with complete control over its ERC20 representation.
  </Step>
</Steps>
