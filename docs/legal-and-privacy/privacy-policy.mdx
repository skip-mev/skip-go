**Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies**

We utilize cookies and other data collection technologies on our Services. A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer that helps us understand how you and our other visitors use the Services, to enhance the user experience through different features and functionality and to analyze and compile usage data. Personal Information collected by cookies may include your device’s IP address, browser type, operating system, computer platform, web pages viewed and/or the date and time of your visit. For example, we may use cookies to remember your preferences or settings. We may also use Software Development Kits (“**SDKs**”) on the Services for services related to on-ramping and maintenance of crypto wallets. SDKs are a collection of tools or libraries that we may use to add functionality to the Services.

Most browsers include tools to manage or disable cookies. You can visit the help function on most browsers to modify how your browser handles cookies. However, if you disable cookies, some features of the Services may not function properly.

Cookies can be categorized by how long they remain on your device. All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser. There are two broad categories of duration:

Session Cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that exist only during an online session and are not stored on your computer or mobile device.

Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies are those placed on your computer or mobile device for a pre-determined length of time when you visit our Website, Interface or otherwise access the Services. Persistent cookies remain on your device until deleted manually or automatically.

To assist us with the various uses and purposes described in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information, including information collected by cookies or similar data collection technologies, may be aggregated, analyzed or linked to other information we have about you (including information from other online and offline sources). For example, we may use Service Providers to collect information about your use of the Services, such as pages viewed via the Website, to provide us reports about your use of the Services.

Global Privacy Control. The Global Privacy Control (“**GPC**”) is a method for individuals to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information, as such term is described under applicable data protection laws, via a user-enabled privacy control that is available on certain internet browsers. Our systems are not configured to detect or respond to the GPC. You can learn more about the GPC [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

“Do Not Track” Signals. Some web browsers have “Do Not Track” or similar features that allow you to tell each website you visit that you do not want your activities on that website tracked. Currently, the Services do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals and will continue to collect information about you even if your browser’s “Do Not Track” functionality is activated. Please note that your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information.
