## Overview

Skip Explorer v2 provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing cross-chain transactions and tracking their progress. This guide covers basic explorer usage and how integrators can leverage it to enhance their user experience.

## Basic Explorer Usage

Users can view transaction details by navigating to [explorer.skip.build](https://explorer.skip.build) and entering:

- **Transaction Hash**: Any transaction hash from a supported chain
- **Chain ID**: The chain where the transaction occurred

The explorer will automatically detect and display:
- Transaction status and progress
- Cross-chain hops and bridges used
- Asset transfers and swaps
- Real-time updates as transactions progress

## Integration for Custom Frontends

If you're building a custom frontend and want to provide users with rich transaction visualization, you can generate explorer links that include comprehensive route data.

### Basic Explorer Links

For simple transaction tracking, redirect users to the explorer with URL parameters:

- `tx_hash`: Comma-separated list of transaction hashes
- `chain_id`: The initial source chain ID  
- `is_testnet`: Optional boolean parameter for testnet transactions

**Example:**
```
https://explorer.skip.build/?tx_hash=ABC123,DEF456&chain_id=osmosis-1&is_testnet=true
```

This approach works well when you have transaction hashes but limited route context.

### Advanced Rich Data Integration

For a superior user experience with complete transaction context, encode your route data as base64 and pass it via the `data` parameter. This enables the explorer to display detailed multi-hop transaction flows, user addresses, and complete route information.

**Example:**
```
https://explorer.skip.build/?data=eyJyb3V0ZSI6ey4uLn0sInVzZXJBZGRyZXNzZXMiOnsuLi59fQ==
```

#### Required Data Structure

The base64-encoded data must contain a JSON object with this structure:

```typescript
{
  route: SimpleRoute,                    // Route from /v2/fungible/route API response
  userAddresses: UserAddress[],          // User wallet addresses for each chain
  transactionDetails: TransactionDetails[], // Transaction details from /v2/tx/status
  status: RouteStatus                    // Current route status
}
```

#### Implementation

```typescript
import { SimpleRoute, UserAddress, TransactionDetails, RouteStatus } from '@skip-go/client';

// Collect your data from Skip Go APIs
const routeData = {
  route: simpleRoute,              // From your /v2/fungible/route call
  userAddresses: userAddresses,    // Your user's addresses per chain  
  transactionDetails: txDetails,   // From your /v2/tx/status polling
  status: routeStatus             // Current route status
};

// Encode for the explorer
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(routeData);
const base64Encoded = btoa(jsonString); // Browser-compatible base64 encoding

// Generate the rich explorer URL  
const explorerUrl = `https://explorer.skip.build/?data=${base64Encoded}`;

// Redirect user or open in new tab
window.open(explorerUrl, '_blank');
```

## Benefits for Your Users

### Basic Integration Benefits
- **Quick Access**: Users can easily view transaction details without leaving your app
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Works across all supported chains and bridges
- **Real-time Updates**: Live transaction status and progress tracking

### Advanced Integration Benefits
- **Complete Transaction Context**: Users see the full route, not just individual transactions
- **Multi-Hop Visualization**: Clear view of complex transfers across chains and bridges  
- **Address Mapping**: Explorer knows which addresses belong to the user
- **Real-time Status**: Current transaction state integrated with visual progress
- **Shareable Links**: Users can bookmark or share complete transaction context

## Best Practices

### When to Use Basic vs Advanced Integration

**Use Basic Integration when:**
- You only have transaction hashes available
- Users initiated transactions outside your application
- You want minimal integration effort

**Use Advanced Integration when:**
- You have complete route information from Skip Go APIs
- Users initiated transactions through your application
- You want to provide the richest user experience

## Common Use Cases

### Transaction Confirmation Pages
After users submit a transaction, redirect them to the explorer with full context:

```typescript
// After transaction submission
const explorerUrl = generateExplorerLink(routeData);
window.location.href = explorerUrl;
```

### Transaction History
Provide explorer links for each historical transaction:

```typescript
// In transaction history component
{transactions.map(tx => (
  <div key={tx.id}>
    <span>{tx.amount} {tx.asset}</span>
    <a href={generateExplorerLink(tx)} target="_blank">
      View Details
    </a>
  </div>
))}
```

### Support and Debugging
Help users troubleshoot failed transactions by providing detailed explorer views:

```typescript
// For failed transactions
const supportUrl = generateExplorerLink(failedTransaction);
// Share this URL with support team or user
```

<Info>
**Best Practice**: Always use the advanced base64 approach when you have access to complete route information from your Skip Go integration. This provides the richest user experience in the explorer.
