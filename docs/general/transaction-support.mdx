title: Transaction Support
---

## **Overview**

- This guide outlines how to troubleshoot and escalate issues related to Skip Go transactions.
- The Skip Go Explorer should be used when troubleshooting
- Types of transactions supported (CCTP, Eureka, Layerzero, Stargate, Opinit, Axelar, IBC, Go Fast)
- Tools: [Explorer](https://explorer.skip.build/), Skip API

---

## **Step 1: Check Status in our Explorer**

- Use our [Explorer](https://explorer.skip.build/)
- If you click on your link transaction in your history on [go.skip.build](https://go.skip.build/) it will open with the transaction details preloaded.

</p>
- If you do not have the transaction in your history, please locate the source transaction hash and enter it into our [Explorer](https://explorer.skip.build/)
- Required inputs:
  - Initial Transaction hash
  - Chain Name

</p>

## **Step 2: Transaction status**

`state_completed_success`, `state_pending`, `state_abandoned`, etc. The explorer will tell you where your funds have been released if the transaction has failed, the swap failed and what asset has been released.

</p>

- If there is no state given, the explorer will ask to reindex/track your transaction:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/explorer-index-page.png" alt="Explorer asking to index" width="700"/>
</p>

- After indexing, the status of your transaction will be updated. Example of successful, failed and pending states:

  <img src="/images/explorer-after-indexing-state.png" alt="Explorer after indexing result" width="700"/>
</p>

- The explorer will show where your funds have been released on chain:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/explorer-failed-funds-released-on-chain.png" alt="Funds released info" width="700"/>
</p>

- If your IBC transaction is pending, it may take upto 24hours to clear.

= If you cannot find where your funds are released, refunded, received, please go to [Step 3](#step-3-escalate-if-needed).
