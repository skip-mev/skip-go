## Background

This doc describes functionality in Skip Go for accessing standardized information about the various fees that a user can incur while swapping or transferring. Common fees include:

* Affiliate fees (e.g. fees you charge the user for swapping on your frontend)
* Bridge and relayer fees
* Smart Relayer fees
* Gas fees

### How Bridging Fees Are Applied
The method for applying bridging fees depends on the source chain of the transfer:

*   **EVM-Source Transfers**: When a bridge transfer originates from an EVM-based chain (e.g., Ethereum), and the fee is paid in the native token of that chain (like ETH), the fee is typically an *additional charge* on top of the amount being transferred. This approach is common among underlying bridge providers, and we maintain this behavior for consistency across all EVM-source transfers, whether for ERC20 tokens or native assets.

*   **Cosmos-Source Transfers**: For transfers originating from Cosmos-based chains, bridging fees are *deducted directly* from the transferred asset amount. Consequently, the amount received on the destination chain will reflect this deduction.

## Understanding incurred fees from all sources: `estimated_fees`

`estimated_fees` in the response of `/route` and `/msgs_direct` provides a `Fee` array where each entry gives information about a particular fee.

Each `Fee` object in the array will have the following attributes:

* `fee_type`: Enum giving the kind of fee â€” `SMART_RELAY` , `SWAP` , `BRIDGE`, `RELAY` , `GAS`
* `bridge_id` : If the fee is a relayer fee (`RELAY`) or a bridge fee (`BRIDGE`), this gives the ID of the bridge charging the fee (or the bridge where the relayer is providing a service)
* `amount` : The amount of the fee (expressed in the token the fee will be charged in)
* `usd_amount`: Estimated USD value of the fee
* `origin_asset` : An `Asset` object containing useful metadata for displaying and identifying the token in which the fee is denominated
* `chain_id` : Chain ID where the fee will be collected
* `denom` : Denom of the token in which the fee is denominated
* `tx_index`: The zero-indexed identifier of the transaction where the user will incur this fee (For multi-transaction routes, fees may be incurred after the first transaction)
* `operation_index`: The zero-indexed entry in the operations array where the user will incur this fee

 <Warning>
 **Included Fees & Current Limitations**

 The `estimated_fees` array consolidates certain fees for easier display. Currently, it includes:
 * `FeeType: SMART_RELAY` for CCTP bridge transfers.
 * `FeeType: BRIDGE` fees for the following specific bridges: `AXELAR`, `HYPERLANE`, and `GO_FAST`.

 Please note that fees for other bridges (`IBC`, `Stargate`, `LayerZero`, etc.) and other fee types like `Swap` or `Gas` are not yet included here and the steps where these fees occur are detailed in the `operations` array. We plan to expand the coverage of `estimated_fees` in the future.
