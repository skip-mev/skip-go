## Background

This doc describes functionality in Skip Go for accessing standardized information about the various fees that a user can incur while swapping or transferring. Common fees include: 

* Affiliate fees (e.g. fees you charge the user for swapping on your frontend)
* Bridge and relayer fees
* Smart Relayer fees
* Gas fees

## Understanding incurred fees from all sources: `estimated_fees`

`estimated_fees` in the response of `/route` and `/msgs_direct` provides a `Fee` array where each entry gives information about a particular fee. 

Each `Fee` object in the array will have the following attributes: 

* `fee_type`: Enum giving the kind of fee â€” `SMART_RELAY` , `SWAP` , `BRIDGE`, `RELAY` , `GAS`
* `bridge_id` : If the fee is a relayer fee (`RELAY`) or a bridge fee (`BRIDGE`), this gives the ID of the bridge charging the fee (or the bridge where the relayer is providing a service)
* `amount` : The amount of the fee (expressed in the token the fee will be charged in)
* `usd_amount`: Estimated USD value of the fee
* `origin_asset` : An `Asset` object containing useful metadata for displaying and identifying the token in which the fee is denominated
* `chain_id` : Chain ID where the fee will be collected
* `denom` : Denom of the token in which the fee is denominated
* `tx_index`: The zero-indexed identifier of the transaction where the user will incur this fee (For multi-transaction routes, fees may be incurred after the first transaction)
* `operation_index`: The zero-indexed entry in the operations array where the user will incur this fee


 <Warning>
**Included Fees & Current Limitations**

 The `estimated_fees` array consolidates certain fees for easier display. Currently, it includes fees for `AXELAR`, `HYPERLANE`, and `GO_FAST` bridges.

 Please note that fees for other bridges (`CCTP`, `IBC`, etc.) and other types like `Swap` or `Gas` fees are not yet included here and must be identified within the `operations` array. We plan to expand the coverage of `estimated_fees` in the future to include more fee types.
